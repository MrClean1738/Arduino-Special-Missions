# Special Missions For Arduino

This repository is a collection of all of my working code or to-be working code for my school Arduino projects where, hopefully in the future, will be able to help students who struggle do challenges that require background or a basic template.

# These are supposed to be easy to do projects

The code in this repository is supposed to be easy to understand (being the amateur coder I am). If some error comes about and you feel overwhelmed, don't worry. You're probably overthinking the project.

# If you do plan on copying my code...

Please if you didn't have this idea for code, please give me credit. If you copied my code because you were making code for someone else, tag me and give me credit for making it. I would really appreciate it.

# Bru.......

Just dont xerox
