# Special Missions For Arduino

This repository is a collection of all of my working code or to-be working code for my school Arduino projects where, hopefully in the future, will be able to help students who struggle do challenges that require background or a basic template.

# These are supposed to be easy to do projects

The code in this repository is supposed to be easy to understand (being the amateur coder I am). If some error comes about and you feel overwhelmed, don't worry. You're probably overthinking the project.
